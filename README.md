## ABOUT THE DATA:
### The folder 'Metabolic_Models' contains the metabolic models from AGORA and CarveMe.
### AGORA   models are within the sub-folder 'ext_int_models_Agora'.
### CarveMe models are within the sub-folder 'ext_int_models_CarveMe'


# To run simulations for:
## Growth rate of Host and Guest as Free Living, run the Script within 'Script_to_Calculate_Growth_from_Unc_to_Sync'
## Uncoordinated Growth, run the Script within 'Script_to_Calculate_Growth_from_Unc_to_Sync'
## Synchronized  Growth, run the Script within 'Script_to_Calculate_Synchronized_Growth'
## Growth from Uncoordinated to synchronized Growth, run the Script within 'Script_to_Calculate_Growth_from_Unc_to_Sync'


# To run those simulations, ensure the functions within the folder 'Functions_Needed_To_Run_Script' are in the same directory.
